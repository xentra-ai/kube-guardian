    // budget between them. See the supervisor module docs.

    // `Err`, extended to cover the clean exits it ignored:
    // `handle_syscall_events`, `handle_network_events` and
    // `handle_policy_drop_events` all return `Ok(())` when their
    // channel closes, and `try_join!` went on waiting for the other
    // eight — a live, healthy-looking, partially-blind Controller.

    // supervision makes easy to lose. Each of the three subsystems that
    // builds a kube client can `?` out of that build when the apiserver
    // is unreachable at boot; today that exits non-zero and the kubelet
    // backs off, and with no liveness, readiness or startup probe on
    // this DaemonSet that CrashLoopBackOff is the only thing an
    // operator sees. It must not become an invisible in-process retry.
    //
    // `ebpf-loader` in particular keeps the property PR #1473 argued
    // for: a Controller whose eBPF loader has died is not degraded, it
    // is blind, and a blind Controller that stays up turns
    // observed-absence-means-safe-to-deny into a lie that nothing
    // marks. Isolating the subsystems from each other's stalls must not
