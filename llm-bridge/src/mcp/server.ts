/**
 * The MCP protocol layer: the same tools the assistant runs in-process,
 * spoken as MCP so external clients (Claude Code, for one) can call them.
 *
 * This uses the SDK's LOW-LEVEL `Server` with raw request handlers rather
 * than `McpServer.registerTool`, and that is the whole point. `registerTool`
 * wants a zod shape and derives the JSON Schema itself, which would give the
 * MCP surface its own hand-maintained copy of every tool's parameters — a
 * second source of truth guaranteed to drift from `TOOL_DEFS` the first time
 * someone edits a description. Handling `tools/list` directly lets
 * `inputSchema` be `TOOL_DEFS[].parameters` passed through verbatim, so an
 * external client and the LLM provider loops see byte-identical definitions
 * and a tool added to the registry cannot silently skip MCP.
