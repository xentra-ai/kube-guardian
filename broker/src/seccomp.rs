//! Per-workload seccomp observation, recommendation and reporting.
//!
//! `pod_syscalls` records one row per pod. This module rolls those up to
//! the stable `(namespace, kind, name)` workload identity the controller
//! puts on `pod_details`, keeps a **monotonic** union of the syscalls
//! ever seen (a profile must cover every code path, and must not narrow
//! when a replica goes away), fingerprints the set, and can render it as
//! a `SeccompProfile` document.
//!
//! Aggregation is triggered from the `/pod/syscalls` ingest path
//! (`add::create_pod_syscalls`) for the workloads whose pods appear in
//! the batch. A pod whose `pod_details` row has no `workload_kind` yet
//! (bare pod, or attribution not resolved) contributes to nothing.
//!
//! # Who owns what (CONTRACT v2)
//!
//! The broker is **never** the source of truth for what is deployed.
//! The user owns a `SeccompProfile` CR (`kguardian.dev/v1alpha1`) — in
//! git, typically — the controller reconciles it onto nodes, and the
//! broker only:
//!
//! 1. **observes** syscalls at a capture *tier* (`full | high | medium |
//!    low | custom`, stamped per pod on `pod_details.capture_level`);
//!    only `full` records every syscall, so `capture_summary` folds the
//!    pods that contributed to a workload's union to the LOWEST tier and
//!    `complete` is true only when every contributor is `full`;
//! 2. **recommends**: the `/export` route renders the observed set as a
//!    CR manifest the user can commit. Every manifest states its capture
//!    tier in `metadata.annotations` (`kguardian.dev/capture-level` /
//!    `-complete` / `-warning`) and on `X-Kguardian-Capture-*` response
//!    headers, so the partial-capture signal survives `kubectl apply`
//!    and GitOps rendering instead of living only in a YAML comment. An
//!    *enforcing* `defaultAction` on a partial capture is refused with
//!    `409` unless the caller passes `acknowledgePartial=true`;
//!    audit-only (`SCMP_ACT_LOG`) exports are always allowed;
//! 3. **reports**: the controller mirrors every CR it sees into
//!    `seccomp_crs` and every node's on-disk files into
//!    `seccomp_node_status`, and the summary endpoints fold those into a
//!    `cr` block — deployed action, per-node readiness (path + hash
//!    match) and **drift** between the observed set and the CR's
//!    allow-list.
//!
//! The observed union is never edited here; an "override" is an edit to
//! the CR. One file per CR on a node: `kguardian/<namespace>/<cr>.json`.

    // the container died at steady ingest with zero `/pod/traffic` reads in
    // its log, so the budget that already existed never engaged.

    // BUT THE PERMIT IS NOT WHAT FIXES THAT, and it should not be read as
    // the remedy. Measured on the dev cluster, four SEQUENTIAL calls 25s
    // apart moved RSS 352 -> 366 -> 381 -> 396 -> 411 MiB: ~15 MiB per call,
    // linear, nothing reclaimed in between. A permit is released when the
    // handler returns, so retention that outlives the response is invisible
    // to the budget — it holds no permit and `available_kib` counts it free.
    // A semaphore cannot bound a quantity that persists after the request
    // completes.
    //
    // Nor would it have fired here. Both callers are self-limiting to one
    // in-flight request each: `useSeccompProfiles` holds an `inflight` ref
    // and returns early while a call is outstanding, and the seccomp
    // distributor ticks a single reconciler loop every 30s. Steady state is
    // 2 concurrent against a reservation that admits 4, so in the exact
    // configuration that killed the broker this permit would never have been
    // contended.
    //
    // What attacks the measured growth is `workload_summaries` below, which
    // no longer reads the syscall blobs at all: the count comes from a stored
    // column, and blobs are fetched only for workloads whose drift is
    // actually computed. The permit is a guardrail for a future caller with
    // no in-flight guard, and it closes the structural gap that every read in
    // get.rs is admitted while every read here was not.
    //
    // Charged from the REAL counts on BOTH axes, not a flat assumption.
    //
    // The previous `ASSUMED_MAX_WORKLOADS` reservation under-charged above
    // its assumed count, so it failed open on exactly the clusters big enough
    // to need it. Charging `COUNT(*)` fixes that axis, but on its own it just
    // moves the same failure one axis over: `SECCOMP_WORKLOAD_COST_BYTES` is
    // derived for a workload whose blob is NOT read, and
    // `workload_summaries` still reads the blob for every CR-referenced
    // workload. Charging the no-blob rate for those under-bills them 2-4x,
    // and it does so on the axis this product is trying to grow, since the
    // whole feature exists to get operators committing SeccompProfile CRs.
    //
    // So: two cheap counts, and a charge that tracks what the handler will
    // actually do. `SECCOMP_BLOB_COST_BYTES` is the surcharge for a workload
    // whose names are materialised.
    //
    // Both counts run before the permit, so a request that is ultimately shed
    // still costs two round trips, and the counts can go stale against the
    // load below. Both are accepted: the alternative is charging after doing
    // the work, which is not a bound.
