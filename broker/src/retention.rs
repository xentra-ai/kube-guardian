//! Periodic cleanup of old audit_verdicts rows.
//!
//! The audit_verdicts table grows monotonically with the volume of
//! "would deny" flow events. Without a retention policy, indexes
//! degrade and disk usage climbs indefinitely on busy clusters.
//!
//! This module spawns a tokio task on broker startup that wakes every
//! `RETENTION_INTERVAL` and prunes expired rows in batches:
//!
//! ```text
//! WITH expired AS (
//!     SELECT id FROM audit_verdicts
//!     WHERE observed_at < timezone('UTC', NOW()) - INTERVAL '<N> days'
//!     ORDER BY id LIMIT <batch_size>
//! )
//! DELETE FROM audit_verdicts WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM expired);
//! ```
//!
//! Batching keeps each transaction's lock hold and WAL chunk bounded,
//! so a one-time large prune (e.g. operator drops retention from 365
//! days to 7) doesn't block concurrent INSERTs from the broker's
//! ingest path or balloon WAL. Each batch is its own
//! `spawn_blocking` call so the broker's blocking pool stays
//! responsive between iterations.
//!
//! Configuration:
//!
//! - `AUDIT_VERDICTS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) — anything older than
//!   N days is eligible for deletion. Setting to 0 disables retention.
//! - `AUDIT_VERDICTS_RETENTION_INTERVAL_SECS` (default 3600 = 1h) — how
//!   often the cleanup task runs.
//! - `AUDIT_VERDICTS_RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE` (default 5_000, clamped to
//!   [100, 100_000]) — rows deleted per batch.
//!
//! Errors are logged and the task continues; a transient DB outage
//! never crashes the broker.
//!
//! # Compute history (design D5)
//!
//! A second loop, on its own cadence (`COMPUTE_RETENTION_INTERVAL_SECS`,
//! default 600), keeps the compute tables bounded:
//!
//! 1. **Downsample**: minute rows (`resolution_secs = 60`) older than
//!    `COMPUTE_HISTORY_MINUTE_HOURS` (default 24) are folded per
//!    `(container_uid, 5-minute bucket)` into one `resolution_secs = 300`
//!    row — avg of avgs, max of maxes, last-by-ts of lasts, summed
//!    counters, element-wise summed `runq_hist` — and the minute rows
//!    deleted in the SAME transaction, one bounded range of whole
//!    buckets per batch (see `downsample_range`).
//! 2. **Prune**: `pod_compute_history` and `pod_contention_history` rows
//!    older than `COMPUTE_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7; 0 disables
//!    history entirely, ingest included) — same batched CTE DELETE.
//! 3. **Dead containers**: `pod_compute_latest` rows not refreshed for
//!    10 minutes (the container is gone, or its node's controller is).
//!    Runs regardless of the history setting.
